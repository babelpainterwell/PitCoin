**Key Functionalities**

- Block Validation:

Proof-of-Work (PoW) Verification: Check that the block header’s hash meets the target difficulty.
Merkle Root Verification: Ensure the Merkle root in the block header matches the Merkle tree computed from the transactions.
Timestamp and Version Checks: Make sure the block’s timestamp is valid (e.g., not too far in the future) and that it uses an acceptable version.
Block Size and Weight Limits: Enforce limits to prevent abuse.

- Transaction Validation:

Script Verification: Execute and validate the scripts (scriptSig, scriptPubKey, and witness data) to ensure signatures are valid.
Input/Output Balance: Check that the sum of inputs equals the sum of outputs (plus fees).
Double Spending and UTXO Verification: Ensure each input is unspent and exists in the UTXO set.
Coinbase & Block Reward Rules: Validate the coinbase transaction structure and that block rewards (plus fees) are correctly computed.

- UTXO Management:

UTXO Set Updates: As blocks are added or removed (in case of reorganizations), update the database of unspent outputs.
Efficient Querying: Enable fast lookups to verify if an input is spending an unspent output.

- Difficulty Adjustment:

Adjust the difficulty target periodically (e.g., every 2016 blocks in Bitcoin) to maintain a consistent block time.

- Chain Reorganization:

When competing chains occur, the node must determine which chain to follow (usually the one with the most work) and reorganize its state accordingly.
